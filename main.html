    <h1>The Tools, Paradigms, and Systems for Tackling the World</h1>
    <p>Inspired by the book, "How Will You Measure Your Life?", I realized that the problems we face everyday are multifaceted
        and ever changing. They often require unstructured problem solving. Instead of knowing that answer to 1045 * 1384 equals... well, whatever it equals,
        we can learn the tools that allow us to solve the same kind of problem forever.

        Here are all of the tools that I have gathered from books, experience, friends and family, and most importantly, divine sources like the holy scriptures.

    systems I need to build:
        Q2 planning system for communication, cooking, coding
        arona system
        flagpole system
        
        
        Studying system
            1. check Notion for all upcoming tasks
            2. determine time interval for all assignments due that day
            3. make 30 min - 1 hr of Q2 studying time for other classes
        
        Flagpoles are a good one to have in your holster, but your main weapon should
        be your creativity operating under the desire to follow the Savior, lift others,
        and chase your dreams. Your planning is where the strategy is, but day to day,
        you are in charge of high level implementation and execution with adaptation as
        needed. YOU are the sharp tool. So don't strategize during the day. Execute the plan
        and adapt as you deem fit.

        There is one great flagpole. Take a breath. What tool or model can help me win? Go.
