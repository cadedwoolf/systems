    <h2>The Big Picture - Who I Am, What Is My Purpose, and Why It Matters</h2>
    <a href="main.html">Portal</a>
    <h3>
        Who I Am:
    </h3>
    <p>
        I am a child of God. I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. I am a good man, with a role to play
        in God's plan. I was made to have joy and fulfill my potential. And to help my brothers 
        and sisters do the same.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What is My Purpose?
    </h3>
    <p>
        My mission is to return home - together with my brothers and sisters. We are to live up to exactly
        what we were always meant to. To fulfill our potential and to have joy both in the journey
        and our final destination when we enter the presence of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why It Matters:
    </h3>
    <p>
        The world is full of suffering and sin. In this life, it is easy to want to settle for
        the temporal pleasures the world has to offer.
        But we were made to become something more. We are a part of a loving family.
        We are fighting to return home, reunited with our ancestors, our Heavenly Parents, and
        those we love in this life.
        We are fighting to forge a destiny of virtue and character. To push past our limits and
        see what we can accomplish.
        We are fighting for everything good, and noble, and happy. Everything relies on living up
        to our divine identity and purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>How Will We Get There: </h2>
    <p>It's very simple. We will live the gospel of Jesus Christ, following His teachings, inviting others
        to do the same. In the meantime, we will strive to grow each day through the achievement
        of worthy goals and enjoy meaningful time with the people we love on Earth.
    </p>
    <h3>Speed Dial Systems</h3>
    <p> In order to remember and neatly package these reminders into practical flagpole protocols, here
        are the 4 key systems to always have ready at a moment's notice.
        The rest of the systems and tools in this toolbox can be used when they are needed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Israel - Let God Prevail. When I am tempted by anything dark or below
        my identity as a son of God:
    </h5>
    <ol>
        <li>2 Tap, signed "i" over my heart</li>
        <li>Ask yourself, "How valiant can I be?"</li>
        <li>As a son of God and disciple of Jesus Christ, make the right choice 
            that brings us closer home.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Unbreakable - Look unto the Savior when you are facing a challenge, a hardship, or failure
        of any kind.
    </h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 5 deep breathes</li>
        <li>"Cade, you're doing great. Nothing can break you if you look unto Him. Now go
            win the next battle."
        </li>
        <li>Everything worth having is counting on you practicing and learning strength and
            leaning on the Savior. You can do this. Nothing can break you if you look unto Him.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Discipline - We Gotta Go. When you are feeling tired, discouraged, or anything that conflicts
        with violently executing the plans you have committed to.
    </h5>
    <ol>
        <li>2 Tap, signed "d" on your eyebrow</li>
        <li>"Don't think, just go."</li>
        <li>Start with just one minute. Anyone can do 1 minute of anything. Then keep going. Tired, sad, lonely
            , hungry. You won't always feel like it, but doing the little things consistently
            lead to the compounding interest of future success.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Outward - Lifting my Brothers and Sisters. Understanding others when they are difficult
        and being a lifting force in their lives.
    </h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Wipe your eyes, signed "o"</li>
        <li>"Everyone is trying their best."
        </li>
        <li>Everyone needs a little bit of help. Think about how fun it will be when we all walk home together.
            We just need to be there for each other and bring out the best in one another.
        </li>
    </ol>
